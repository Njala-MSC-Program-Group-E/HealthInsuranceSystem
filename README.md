# Health Insurance System
Abstract: This project involves developing a comprehensive Health Insurance System that leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and advanced data structures and algorithms. The system aims to manage health insurance policies, claims, and customer data efficiently. It will include features such as policy management, claim processing, customer records, and premium calculations. The primary goal is to automate the insurance process, ensuring accuracy, speed, and security.
# Objectives:
1.	Policy Management: Automate the creation, updating, and deletion of insurance policies.
2.	Claim Processing: Streamline the claim submission, approval, and payout processes.
3.	Customer Management: Maintain an organized database of customer information, including their insurance policies and claims history.
4.	Premium Calculation: Implement an algorithm for calculating insurance premiums based on customer data and policy details.
5.	Reporting: Generate detailed reports on policies, claims, and customer data.
6.	Security: Ensure that sensitive customer data is securely stored and accessed.
# Technologies Used:
•	Programming Language: Java
•	Frameworks: Spring Boot for backend, Hibernate for ORM
•	Database: MySQL
•	Testing Tools: JUnit for unit testing
•	IDE: Visual Studio Code/Eclipse
